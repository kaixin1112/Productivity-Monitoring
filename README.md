## Table of Contents

### Introduction  
This project is an **AI-powered productivity monitoring system** designed to automate **operator tracking, workflow monitoring, and quality control** in manufacturing. Using **pose detection (Mediapipe)** and **object detection (YOLOv5)**, the system enhances efficiency, reduces manual supervision, and ensures **real-time feedback** for optimized operations.  

### Overview  
🔹 **Problem:** Manual monitoring is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks real-time insights.  
🔹 **Solution:** AI-driven system for **real-time tracking, automated quality checks, and performance monitoring** using a multi-camera setup.  

## Features
